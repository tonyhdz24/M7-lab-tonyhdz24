# M7 lab - CSS Layout

## Overview

The purpose of this module 7's lab was to familiarize ourselves with the different CSS layout options such as FlexBox and Grid. This lab gave us a chance to learn more about and how to use them. Not only that but also how to use them to create a responsive webpage layout.

## How to run code

- To run the code open up your terminal and cd to the folder were you want to copy the repository to

  `cd path/to/your/directory`

- Once in the desired folder use the command git clone to copy the repo there

  `git clone https://github.com/tonyhdz24/M7-lab-tonyhdz24`

- Then cd into the newly cloned repo

  ` cd M7-lab-tonyhdz24`

- Once in the repo folder install any dependencies the repo requires  
   `npm install`

- Lastly open the cloned repo in your IDE open index.html and use Live Preview to view the webpage

  ` code .`
